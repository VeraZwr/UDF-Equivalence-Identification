= Introduction
To allow for greater expressivity, many modern Stream Processing Systems (SPS) allow the utilization of User Defined Functions (UDF) #citation-wanted.
UDFs allow users to write logic in their preferred programming language to then be used in the SQL Queries.

- UDFs present an optimization barrier to the SPS





Modern Stream Processing Systems utilitze Multi Query Optimization to optimize across multiple concurrent queries.


- optimizing UDFs is hard, they introduce an optimization barrier


= Background
- what are UDFs
- show example of UDF

= Approach

= Implementation

= Evaluation

== How we evaluated

== Results

= Future Work
- in our approach

- other approaches


= Conclusion

== Did we achieve what we set out to do?
== How viable is the chosen approach to achieve the desired result?
